The Heavy configuration consists of a structurallystrengthened Falcon  as the core component with two additional Falcon  first stages acting as liquid fuel strapon boosters which is conceptually similar to EELV Delta IV Heavy launcher and proposals for the Atlas V Heavy and Russian Angara AV Falcon Heavy has more lift capability than any other operational rocket with a payload of  kilograms  lb to low earth orbit and  kilograms  lb to transMars injection The rocket was designed to meet or exceed all current requirements of human rating The structural safety margins are  above flight loads higher than the  margins of other rockets Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and it would restore the possibility of flying crewed missions to the Moon or Mars

The first stage is powered by three Falcon  derived cores each equipped with nine Merlin D engines The Falcon Heavy has a total sealevel thrust at liftoff of  kN  lbf from the  Merlin D engines while thrust rises to  kN  lbf as the craft climbs out of the atmosphere The upper stage is powered by a single Merlin D engine modified for vacuum operation with a thrust of  kN  lbf an expansion ratio of  and a nominal burn time of  seconds At launch the center core throttles to full power for a few seconds for additional thrust then throttles down This allows a longer burn time After the side boosters separate the center core throttles back up to maximum thrust For added reliability of restart the engine has dual redundant pyrophoric igniters TEATEB The interstage which connects the upper and lower stage for Falcon  is a carbon fiber aluminum core composite structure Stage separation occurs via reusable separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system The Falcon  tank walls and domes are made from aluminiumlithium alloy SpaceX uses an allfriction stir welded tank The second stage tank of Falcon  is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling material and manufacturing techniques This approach reduces manufacturing costs during vehicle production

All three cores of the Falcon Heavy arrange the engines in a structural form SpaceX calls Octaweb aimed at streamlining the manufacturing process and each core includes four extensible landing legs To control the descent of the boosters and center core through the atmosphere SpaceX uses small grid fins which deploy from the vehicle after separation Immediately after the side boosters separate the center engine in each burns for a few seconds in order to control the boosterâ€™s trajectory safely away from the rocket The legs then deploy as the boosters turn back to Earth landing each softly on the ground The center core continues to fire until stage separation after which its legs deploy and land back on Earth on a drone ship The landing legs are made of carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb The four legs stow along the sides of each core during liftoff and later extend outward and down for landing Both the grid fins and the landing legs on the Falcon Heavy are currently undergoing testing on the Falcon  launch vehicle and are intended to be used for vertical landing once the postmission technology development effort is completed

Although not a part of the initial Falcon Heavy design SpaceX is doing parallel development on a reusable rocket launching system that is intended to be extensible to the Falcon Heavy recovering all parts of the rocket

Early on SpaceX had expressed hopes that all rocket stages would eventually be reusable SpaceX has since demonstrated both land and sea recovery of the first stage of the Falcon  a number of times and have made attempts to recover the fairing This approach is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket much earlier in the flight profile and are therefore both moving at a lower velocity at the initial separation event Since late  every Falcon  first stage has been instrumented and equipped as a controlleddescent test vehicle For the first flight of Falcon Heavy SpaceX was considering the possibility of recovering the second stage

SpaceX has indicated that the Falcon Heavy payload performance to geosynchronous transfer orbit GTO will be reduced due to the addition of the reusable technology but would fly at a much lower perlaunch price With full reusability on all three booster cores GTO payload will be  kg  lb If only the two outside cores fly as reusable cores while the center core is expendable GTO payload would be approximately  kg  lb A Falcon Heavy launch with recovery of all three firststage cores thus delivers less payload mass to GTO than the fully expendable Delta IV Heavy at  kg  lb and somewhat more if the Falcon Heavy center core is expended

At an appearance in May  before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation Musk testified Long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a superheavy if there is customer demand We expect that each size increase would result in a meaningful decrease in cost per pound to orbit  Ultimately I believe  per pound or less is very achievable This  per kilogram lb goal stated by Musk in  is  of the cost of the lowestcostperpound LEOcapable launch system in a circa study the Zenit a mediumlift launch vehicle that can carry  kilograms  lb into LEO

As of March  Falcon Heavy launch prices are below  per kilogram lb to lowEarth orbit when the launch vehicle is transporting its maximum delivered cargo weight The published prices for Falcon Heavy launches have moved some from year to year with announced prices for the various versions of Falcon Heavy priced at  million in  M in  M in  M for up to  kilograms  lb to GTO in  and M for up to  kilograms  lb to GTO in  with no published price for heavier GTO or any LEO payload Launch contracts typically reflect launch prices at the time the contract is signed

In  SpaceX stated that the cost of reaching low Earth orbit could be as low as  per kilogram lb if an annual rate of four launches can be sustained and as of  planned to eventually launch as many as  Falcon Heavy and  Falcon  annually A third launch site intended exclusively for SpaceX private use is planned at Boca Chica Village Texas SpaceX started construction on the third Falcon Heavy launch facility in  with the first launches from the facility no earlier than late  In late  SpaceX had projected Falcon Heavys inaugural flight to be in  but it did not occur until February  due to limited manufacturing capacity and the need to deliver on the Falcon  launch manifest

By late  SpaceX prices for space launch were already the lowest in the industry SpaceXs price for reused spacecraft could be reduced up to
